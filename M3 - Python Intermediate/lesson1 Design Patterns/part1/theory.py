Design Patterns 101 (Python) – minimal & practical
==================================================

What are design patterns?
-------------------------
Reusable ways to structure code to solve common design problems:
• **Creational** – how objects are created. Provides object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
• **Structural** – how objects are composed and related. Explains how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
• **Behavioral** – how objects communicate and assign responsibilities. Takes care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.


Keep in mind (Python flavor):
• Python is dynamic and duck‑typed; many patterns are simpler than in Java/C++.
• Prefer readability; don’t over‑engineer.


This will print demos for 6 patterns:
• Creational: Singleton, Factory Method
• Structural: Adapter, Decorator
• Behavioral: Strategy, Observer


If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

This is the problem that haunts many novices who have just familiarized themselves with patterns.
Having learned about patterns, they try to apply them everywhere, even in situations where simpler code would do just fine
