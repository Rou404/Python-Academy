====================================================


Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code.

Patterns (each file is self-contained):
  - singleton_demo.py
  - factory_method_demo.py
  - adapter_demo.py
  - decorator_demo.py
  - strategy_demo.py
  - observer_demo.py

Exercises (with TODOs):
  - ex1_exporter_strategy_factory.py
  - ex2_weather_adapter_decorator.py

To run an individual demo:

Or run all demos:
    python run_all_demo.py
