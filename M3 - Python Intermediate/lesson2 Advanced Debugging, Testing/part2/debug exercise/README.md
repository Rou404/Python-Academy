# Debugger Exercise: `SalesAnalytics` (buggy on purpose)

Goal: Use the debugger (breakpoints, watches, step-in/out) to find and fix a series of **logic bugs** in
`SalesAnalytics`. The code is syntactically valid but contains >10 issues spanning parsing, sorting,
caching, off-by-one errors, and state management.

- Run `python tests.py`. Tests FAIL until you fix all problems.
- Data is loaded from a CSV that the test writes to a temporary folder.
- Fix issues one by one until all tests pass.
